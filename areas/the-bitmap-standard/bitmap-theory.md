<details>

<summary><code>blocktime = blockspace</code></summary>

Bitmap Theory applies Einstein's Theory of Relativity to Bitcoin. The concept of Spacetime is extended to the Blockchain Timechain. In the same way we equate space to time, we do this by converting Blocktime to Blockspace.

<summary><code>e=mc2 : energy (e) is equal to the velocity (c) of mass (m) exchange squared</code></summary>

Energy can be measured by the velocity of mass in an exchange. This applies in economics, where money velocity is a key performance indicator of a healthy economy, similar to a boilers pressure gauge. This provides a useful frame to measure the energetic states of systems such as Bitcoin.

<summary><code>equivalence : each bitcoin parameter should finds natural spatial analogue</code></summary>

Bitcoin captures snapshots of global human economic activity upon the Bitcoin Blockchain roughly every ten minutes. These snapshots are known as blocks. Each block is a powerful time capsule that may be reference and drawn upon across time from the point it was mined, until the very last Bitcoin node goes dark. The cryptographic time-energy data captured within the blocks are extremely powerful vessels, thought to carry within them entire worlds that can be unveiled by alchenomist equating spatial analogues and using this to transmute between the time and space.

<summary><code>blockstep : we observe and resolve commands each block according to ruleset</code></summary>

Every ten minutes, on average, a new Bitcoin Block is mined. We consider this one STEP within blocktime, otherwise known as one blockstep. This rule borrows from turn-based games such as Magic The Gathering, and provides a useful framework to build chain-based rule systems, by accepting the core premise that blockstep is how we measure steps across the timechain.

<details>

<summary><code>resolution : the resolution of each blockstep can be derived by the same ruleset</code></summary>

Each block is a set of instructions. In native Bitcoin, these instructions simply convey a value transfer of Bitcoin units between wallets. It is the miners that resolve these transfers cryptographically, through Proof of Work. Within Ordinals Theory, these instructions become more complex, using the indexing of satoshi's as the basis for co-ordination and data storage. In this sense, it is the indexers that resolve the rule system of Ordinals, they are the referee. This may seem like a central point of failure at first, but in reality the referee's are there to enforce the rules which supercede them. Any referee who is not upholding the rules of the game is replaced. This puts the ruleset at the core of any meta-protocol such as Ordinals and Bitmap that require proper indexing. So long as the ruleset will lead to the same results, resolution can occur regardless.
