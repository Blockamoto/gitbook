# ‚ùî ruleset 3

{% hint style="warning" %}
AIM: a universal co-ordinates system for Bitmap.
{% endhint %}

Ruleset 3 is a proposed addition to [the-bitmap-standard](areas/the-bitmap-standard/ "mention") being written by Bitoshi Blockamoto.

But he needs your help!

This proposed ruleset should serve to open up the possible cross-platform use-cases for bitmap.

The standard enables object permanence across bitmap platforms that interface with ruleset 3.

There are four main reference points.

**Blocks:** these are referenced by district blockheight number in `404.bitmap`

**Transactions:** these are referenced by transaction number dot blockheight in `0.404.bitmap`

**Inputs/outputs:** indexing each input and output wallet referenced within the transaction

**Satoshi's:** using ordinals theory we can specifically pinpoint universal co-oridnates using satoshi's
