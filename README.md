Welcome to Bitmap, a transmutational metaverse standard tapping into the Bitcoin Blockchain. Leveraging the Ordinals theory and Bitmap theory, Bitmap offers a groundbreaking way to ascribe claims unto consensual geospatial canvas points across the Bitcoin timechain tapestry. It's a new frontier in the world of decentralized digital ownership and a new understanding of Metaverse.

## What is Bitmap?

Bitmap is an open-source standard that allows anyone to ascribe ownership of a Bitcoin Block by inscribing it onto a Satoshi using Ordinals and the Bitmap standard. This process is equitable and decentralized, turning any Bitcoin block into a part of the Metaverse at the cost of energy.

## How Does Bitmap Work?

With Bitmap, any block on the Bitcoin blockchain can be inscribed as districts, making it an integral part of the Metaverse. Platforms can parse this Block Data into the 3D realm and grant build access to block owners, creating a new paradigm for open-source development. Parcels representing transactions within these district blocks can be made independent from its block by the owner of the district.
