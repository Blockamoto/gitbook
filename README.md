# ðŸ—º bitmap theory 101

Welcome to Bitmap, a transmutational metaverse standard tapping into the Bitcoin Blockchain. Leveraging the Ordinals theory and Bitmap theory, Bitmap offers a groundbreaking way to ascribe claims unto consensual geospatial canvas real estate across a timechain tapestry known as Bitcoin. It's a new frontier in the world of decentralized digital ownership and a new understanding of Metaverse.

### What is Bitmap?

Bitmap is a consensus standard that allows anybody to claim the geospatial digital real estate of a Bitcoin Block. This process is achieved by being the first to inscribe _`blocknumber`_`.bitmap` unto a Satoshi using the Ordinals Inscription standard. This process is equitable and decentralized, transmuting any Bitcoin Block into a part of the Metaverse at the cost of energy. Bitmap was fully inscribed up to the latest block in Summer 2023, but since the Bitcoin Blockchain produces a block roughly every ten minutes, this means there are roughly 144 new Bitmaps (\~10 mins) available to claim each day, however you must

### How Does Bitmap Work?

With Bitmap, any block on the Bitcoin blockchain can be inscribed, making it an integral part of the Metaverse. Platforms can parse this Block Data into the 3D realm and grant build access to block owners, creating a new paradigm for open-source development.

### The Importance of Bitcoin Block Ownership

Ownership of Bitcoin Blocks in the Bitmap standard brings with it a range of possibilities. Owners can inscribe transactions as parcels on their own blocks, effectively fractionalizing a block and making it possible to distribute parts of it to a wider community. This means that block owners can become active contributors to the Metaverse, offering a platform for building upon their blocks and creating vibrant, community-driven spaces.

### Satoshi Blocks and Their Significance

Among the available blocks are a number of 'Satoshi blocks,' those mined by Satoshi Nakamoto in the early days of Bitcoin. These carry a particular historical significance, marking the inception of the Bitcoin blockchain. Owning a Satoshi block is a unique way of holding a piece of Bitcoin history.

### Building the Open Metaverse

At Bitmap, our vision extends beyond the present. The proceeds from initial block sales will be invested in developing the next layer of tools on the Bitmap standard, laying the groundwork for a world built upon these unique digital spaces. Our roadmap includes the open-source development of the standard, and consensus, working closely with platforms looking to build on in this standard.
