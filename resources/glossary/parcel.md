# üè° parcel

The meta land representation of a transaction within a bitcoin block, based upon [the-bitmap-standard](../../areas/the-bitmap-standard/ "mention"). A bitmap parcel is the token, such as 0.404.bitmap, that represents transaction 0 of block 404. Parcels exist within a [district.md](district.md "mention") in the same way as transactions exist within a Bitcoin Block. It is a parent-child relationship. By default, the parcels are part of the district. To detach a parcel from its parent district, it is possible for district owners of a district to [parcel-claim.md](../../archive/\_drafts/parcel-claim.md "mention") by using [bitmap.land](../../areas/bitmap.land/ "mention"), or by following the [parcel-ruleset.md](../../areas/the-bitmap-standard/parcel-ruleset.md "mention")
