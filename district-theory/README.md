# ðŸŒ† district theory

This theory poses that each Bitcoin Block can be claimed as a Bitmap District by the first person who inscribes the _blockheight_ followed by `.bitmap`, like so: `404.bitmap`&#x20;

The valid first district inscription according to the [district-ruleset.md](district-ruleset.md "mention") henceforth becomes indexed. The data upon the bitcoin block makes up the landscape of the bitmap district.

The district inscription itself represents ownership of the bitmap land, which represents the spatial dimensions of the bitcoin block it refers to.
