## Digital Matter Theory

The blockchain can be thought of like the Higgs Boson of the digital realm. The blocks, and therefore the transactions, are the immovable object, given mass to by the miners and nodes with the computing power and network incentives needed to uphold this immutable data layer of the internet. By utilizing the fundamental components of Bitcoin as the foundations of a digital world, the permanence of this world is inherited from Bitcoin. This represents a persistent unified field of data. Digital Matter Theory suggests that this data amounts to digital mass. This theory maps out the co-ordinates of this digital mass and provides a basis for unified building. The purpose of this theory is to provide a ground truth, a framework, and examples for interpretation, and the access points to be able to reference block-space at the most granular level, utilizing the tools of Bitcoin and Ordinals.

## The Bitmap Procedure

The core procedure of the Bitmap protocol is utilizing the data generated by Bitcoin as the core foundation of a digital terrain. As Bitmap Theory is based upon Bitcoin's raw data, it mirror's the unique properties of Bitcoin's data. Through the use of inscriptions as per Ordinals Theory, Bitmap applies consensual digital property rights upon this unified spatial field. The process is open, decentralized, and equitable, allowing anybody to claim digital real estate directly on layer 1 of Bitcoin by applying Ordinals Theory, and to terraform and build on this real estate by applying Bitmap Theory.

**Input.** The Bitcoin Blockchain.

**Algorithm.** Bitcoin data finds its natural spatial analogue.

**Output.** Terrain derived from Bitcoin's geological ground truth.

Developers may utilize the Bitmap Theory and Protocol to build experiences, games, metaverses, among countless other examples based upon block data, and utilizing the valid Bitmap inscription claims as the land deed to this plot. This theoretical framework lays the blueprints to allow owners of Bitmap land inscriptions to pin inscriptions spatially at a various resolutions, from the district level, parcel level, chunk level, down to specific Bitoshi co-ordinates within their Bitmap land, effectively building on-chain with the block data. Bitmap takes a layered approach, starting with the Blocks and extrapolating them to Districts, then Transactions to Parcels, and so forth.

## District Theory

Bitcoin Blocks are represented in Bitmap Theory by Districts. The owners of Districts are recognized as a sort of Admin of the block geo-space by the consensus of those adhering to Bitmap Theory.

When the values of a Bitcoin Block are extrapolated into the spatial realm, we are presented with a map graph of the Block. This Block is made up of Transactions, which Bitmap Theory reads as Parcels. When a Bitmap District is inscribed, the Parcels are considered to be part of the District by default.

That means, until a Parcel is inscribed, it is part of the District and if the District is transferred, the Parcels within it move with it. If Parcels are inscribed in their own right, they do not move with the District. This forms a parent-child relationship between Districts and Parcels.

### INSCRIBING A DISTRICT

_`{block-height}.bitmap`_ : first to inscribe an existing block-height as bitmap is valid owner

`404.bitmap` : this example is an inscription claim for the district representing block 404

## Parcel Theory

The Bitcoin Transactions within the Block are represented in Bitmap Theory as Parcels within the Districts. By default, Parcels are part of the District and do not need to be inscribed separately. Doing so detaches and renders them individual.

{% hint style="info" %}
### INSCRIBING A PARCEL

Parcels are the first valid child inscriptions maintaining provenance from the District parent.

`{tx-index}.{block-height}.bitmap` : a parcel child inscription of a valid district

`0.404.bitmap` : this example is the parcel claim representing transaction 0 of block 404
