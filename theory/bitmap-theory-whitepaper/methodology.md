In the journey from Theory to Product, four key pillars of Bitmap's development have been identified and codified to form a useful framework which can be leveraged to categorize and track efforts.

TRIP is an acronym that stands for _Theory_, _Ruleset_, _Index_, _Product_. Whilst the framework has been devised specifically as an aid for Bitmap, it may be useful as a tool to unify efforts across any discipline with the same core foundational TRIP elements required for their protocol or system to function. The scope of this paper is strictly Bitmap, and so this paper is an example of the application of TRIP as an organizational framework, and its further open development is encouraged.

The methodology forms the base structure of this whitepaper. Each pillar is introduced in this section, why they are vital, how they relate, and the dependencies between each layer.

### THEORY METHODOLOGY

Preceding any ruleset, theoretical underpinnings should be thoroughly developed. This is imperative, as there should be a core insight or basis for the ruleset to exist based on sound theory.

The Theory is the reason the ruleset matters, and it is intrinsically tied to ruleset. With this distinction made, the results of ruleset can be explored and evaluated against their theoretical basis.

The Theory section explores the key insights of Bitmap Theory and proposes a theoretical basis for a unified Metaverse built on Bitcoin. The core thesis behind Bitmap Theory is to consider the idea that Bitcoin, is an energetic transfer device now woven into the fabric of humanity, and introducing the practice of transmutation of data from one state to another, in this case, from Bitcoin to Metaverse.

### RULESET METHODOLOGY

The specific consensus rules which are to be followed by those in agreement with the consensus are to be laid out in a concrete and repeatable ruleset. The ruleset can be applied to the data by parsers of the data, usually through one of the available index providers. This approach allows for the composability of index and application layer.

It is the most decentralized approach, as anybody with access to a Bitcoin node can follow the same ruleset and reach the same result, in theory. The ability for this to be tracked through time is merely a matter of the strength of the ruleset applied to the data. In this case, the ruleset applies to the codification of the Bitcoin map graph, and the added layer of inscriptions and commands that may be recognized by all parties that wish to be a part of this ecosystem.

It can be thought of like a ruleset in a trading card game like Magic: the Gathering. rulesets must be resolvable. To ensure the robustness of the base layer of Bitmap, it is designed in a layered manner. The core layer is the District. This is the immovable object of Bitmap, adopted as the core premise of Bitmap. The next layer is Parcels. And so on. Each ruleset is a layer that can exist, or be used in conjunction with any other layer, or in isolation. These use-cases can be developed by anybody, as can new ruleset layers, and the strength of any new ruleset is often tested live against the market. For example, a ruleset such as the brc420 avatar standard exists in conjunction and interoperable with Bitmap. Any flaws in the ruleset or updates that cause what is essentially a new chain, will bear out in the indexing stage and have drastic impact on the ability to reach the same result from the same data. This is a major risk factor for new protocols, the unintentional forking of the provenance.

The TRIP methodology proposes that the **gold standard** for developing any new protocol ruleset is:

> _**RESOLVABLE AND REPEATABLE**_

This is why the Ruleset from which the Product is ultimately founded upon must be transparent. If accomplished successfully, it means that all developers can work together with a unified ground truth. It is the lens through which the data is viewed through by all consensus participants.

### INDEX METHODOLOGY

For products to be built upon Bitmap, reliable ongoing access to the necessary data is key.

Not every Bitmap developer will be running a full node, so to be able to parse Bitcoin for the inscription and block data from which Bitmap is derived, the data must by served by a third party running a full node or otherwise serving the necessary data. To apply the Ruleset to the data on behalf of the platforms is the role of the index. To enable the ongoing independence of indexers, the ruleset must be resolvable & repeatable, transparent & public. This allows anybody who wishes to build their own index, and keeps all indexers accountable, preventing disparities between indexing efforts by using Bitcoin as the ruleset settlement layer. Anybody can prove whether an Indexer has gone outside of the consensus ruleset or data by testing the results of a ruleset themselves. Indexers carry this burden, and so the importance of accurate indexing cannot be understated, which reinforces the vital role of a resolvable, repeatable ruleset. Bitmap products cannot operate without accurate functional indexing.

### PRODUCT METHODOLOGY

Bitmap products utilize Bitcoin data served by indexers following rulesets based upon Bitmap theory.

Bitmap is designed to allow for different visions for the Metaverse to emerge within the same ecosystem, and different layers of meaning to be applied. Building on Bitmap relies upon stable access to the data, as processed by the index. Developers who build on Bitmap benefit from the existing userbase, and each new product that is built upon Bitmap adds value to the existing userbase. This creates a naturally collaborative and competitive market for Bitmap products.

It largely refers to Bitmap platforms that serve Bitcoin data parsed via Bitmap theory rulesets, but also the inscriptions which are product of the standard.
