## How Does Bitmap Work?

With Bitmap, any block on the Bitcoin blockchain can be built upon as districts. Platforms can parse this Block Data into the 3D realm and grant build access to block owners, creating a new paradigm for open-source development. Parcels representing transactions within these district blocks can be made independent from its block by the district holder.
