# âœ’ parcel claim

The pages within this directory are \_drafts which are yet to be moved into the MAIN directory, so please treat the information within them with caution.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that Xverse wallet users are unable to TAP from within Xverse. We do not advise inscribing parcels with Xverse until TAPPING is a supported feature.

In the meantime, you can use any other wallet that allows for this, such as UniSat.
{% endhint %}



STEP ONE - open parcel view\
Navigate to a district you own on the bitmap and click to open up the parcel view.&#x20;

STEP TWO - select, connect, inscribe

Connect your wallet or add your wallet address. Select your chosen parcels and inscribe.

STEP THREE - TAP

Once confirmed, there is still one action to be taken. You must TAP your district, which means to send the district to yourself. This is an important step, and your parcels will not be verifies until this action is complete.





The full ruleset for parcels can be found in [parcel-ruleset.md](../../areas/the-bitmap-standard/parcel-ruleset.md "mention")
