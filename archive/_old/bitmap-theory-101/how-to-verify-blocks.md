# ✅ How to Verify Blocks

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTICE: indexing is based upon the BITOSHI standard

## CHECK BLOCK

To lookup and verify blocks, you can use LooksOrdinal: [http://looksordinal.com](https://looksordinal.com/)

## BITOSHI STANDARD&#x20;

The BITOSHI STANDARD distinguishes between VERIFIED ✅ and FAKE ❌.

We use the word VERIFIED and FAKE instead of VALID and INVALID due to the fact it is possible to both WRITE and READ inscriptions that are deemed FAKE. We rely on community consensus and healthy debate to come to consensus on the BITOSHI STANDARD.&#x20;

FAKE blocks are not recognized by the BITOSHI STANDARD. We urge you all to verify your own blocks at this stage. Here is the breakdown of what is VERIFIED and what is FAKE:

### VERIFIED ✅

* `69.bitmap` <-- ✅
* BLOCK EXISTS AT TIME OF INSCRIPTION ✅
* FIRST TO CLAIM ✅

### FAKE ❌

* NOT FIRST TO CLAIM ❌
* FUTURE BLOCKS ❌
* `069.bitmap` <-- ❌
* `#69.bitmap` <-- ❌

**NOTE:** please do not be discouraged by FAKENESS of FAKE blocks. Whilst they won't be recognized as standard, that doesn't mean they cannot be implemented in creative ways.
