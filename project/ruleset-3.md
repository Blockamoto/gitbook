{% hint style="warning" %}
AIM: a universal co-ordinates system for Bitmap.
{% endhint %}

Ruleset 3 is a proposed addition to [the-bitmap-standard](../areas/the-bitmap-standard/ "mention") being written by Bitoshi Blockamoto.

This proposed ruleset should serve to open up the possible cross-platform use-cases for bitmap.

The standard enables object permanence across bitmap platforms that interface with ruleset 3.
